Title: Assessing the Partial Association between ordinal variables
Description: An R package of a unified framework for assessing Partial Association 
    between ordinal variables. It includes quantification, visualization, and 
    hypothesis testing. It includes: a "PAsso" function to assess partial 
    association between responses after adjusting covariates, a "test" function 
    to conduct hypothesis testing for partial association, a "plot" function
    to visualize partial regression plot matrix, a "check.model" function to 
    diagnose the specifications of each fitted model. All the tools are based on 
    the paper by Dungang Liu, Shaobo Li, Yan Yu and Irini Moustaki (2019), and the
    approach described in Liu and Zhang (2017) (<https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915>),
    and Greenwell et al. (2017) (<https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-004/index.html>).
