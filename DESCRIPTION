Title: Assessing the Partial Association Between Ordinal Variables
Description: An implementation of the unified framework for assessing partial association 
            between ordinal variables after adjusting for a set of covariates (Dungang Liu, Shaobo 
            Li, Yan Yu and Irini Moustaki (2020), accepted by the Journal of the American 
            Statistical Association). This package provides a set of tools to quantify, visualize, 
            and test partial associations between multiple ordinal variables. It can produce a number
            of $phi$ measures, partial regression plots, 3-D plots, and $p$-values for testing 
            $H_0: phi=0$ or $H_0: phi <= delta$.
