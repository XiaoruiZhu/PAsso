Title: Assessing the Partial Association between Ordinal Variables
Description: An R package of a unified framework for assessing Partial Association 
    between ordinal variables. It includes quantification, visualization, and 
    hypothesis testing. All the tools are based on the paper by  Dungang Liu, 
    Shaobo Li, Yan Yu and Irini Moustaki (2019), and the approach described 
    in Liu and Zhang (2017, <doi:https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915>) 
    and Greenwell et al. (2017, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-004/index.html>).
