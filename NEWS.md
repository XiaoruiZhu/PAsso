# parasol 0.1.1

## Major changes

1. Add `coor` and `coor.test` function to estimate and test the partial correlation coefficients;
2. Update S3 generic functions (print, summary) for the class "PAsso" generated by "coor", and "PAsso.test" generated by "coor.test".  

## Bug fixes

1. "polr" and "glm" functions work;
2. The formula in the model can be shown by the print("PAsso").
