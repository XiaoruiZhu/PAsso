\title{A matrix of partial regression plots between responses after adjustments}
\usage{
\method{plot}{PAsso}(x, color = "blue", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object in "PAsso" class that is generated by "PAsso" or "test".}

\item{color}{The color of points.}

\item{...}{Additional optional arguments to be passed onto.}
}
\value{
A \code{"GGally"} object.
}
\description{
A plot matrix to display the results of partial association analyses.
Upper-triangle contains scatter-plot matrix between each pair of response variables.
Lower-triangle contains the partial correlation coefficients adjusted by covariates.
}
\details{
A pairwise plot matrix reveals the partial association between ordinal variables.
All the plots are based on surrogate residuals generated from \code{"resides"} function.
Graphics are designed based on \code{\link{ggplot2}} and \code{"GGally"}.
